# This is a fork of the linux kernel backports package from:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/backports/backports.git

This is optimized to work better against certain CT kernels.

Example to build bacports image for a 3.19-ish kernel from the 4.16 ct kernel:

Clone backports-ct on Ubuntu-18.
Clone linux-4.16-ct kernel.
In backports tree:  (git revision should be latest linux-CT commit id)
./gentree.py --clean --gitdebug --git-revision 08044ae21d2df7385fbb2363d855d3244e060994 ~/git/linux-ct-4.16 ~/git/linux.3.19-foo-backport-4.16-ct/ --verbose

# I had to make at least one more change to get it to work.  See the top commit(s)
  in the backports-ct-4.16 repo, which was generated by this procedure, for details.



# Linux kernel backports package

This package provides backport support for drivers from newer kernels
down to older kernels. It currently backports the following subsystems:

  * Wireless
  * NFC
  * WWAN

This package provides the latest Linux kernel subsystem enhancements
for kernels 3.10 and above.

# Documentation

This package is documented online and has more-up-to date information
online than on this README file. You should read the wiki page
and not rely on this README!

# License

This work is a subset of the Linux kernel as such we keep the kernel's
Copyright practice. Some files have their own copyright and in those
cases the license is mentioned in the file. All additional work made
to building this package is licensed under the GPLv2.

# Backporting preference for EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() and proprietary drivers

This framework was designed by intent since its inception *only* for upstream
Linux kernel drivers to avoid excuses about the difficulty to support upstream
Linux kernel development while also supporting users on older kernels. To
ensure the intent is respected currently all symbols that we do work on to
backport are exported via EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() as we do work to backport them
for the supported kernels. By using EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() we make it *clear* that
if you use the backported symbols your software *is* considered derivative
works of the Linux kernel.

Comprendes, Mendes?
